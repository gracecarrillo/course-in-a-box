## Why Pandas?

![Image of Pandas]({{site.baseurl}}/img/pandas.png)

- Pandas stands for “Python Data Analysis Library”. 
- Game changer when it comes to analyzing data with Python 
- Pandas is open source, free to use (under a BSD license).
- Takes data (CSV, TSV, SQL etc) and creates a Python object with rows and columns that looks like Excel.
- Is much easier to work with in comparison to lists and/or dictionaries.
