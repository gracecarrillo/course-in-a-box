# Data Science Projects.

As part of the course deliverables, you will have to create your own data science project. Don't worry, I'll give you some code to get started! Choose between these:


### Project –Breast Cancer Classifier in Python

In this small project, you’ll implement a simple machine learning algorithm in Python using Scikit-learn, a machine learning tool for Python. Using a database of breast cancer tumor information, you’ll use a Naive Bayes (NB) classifier that predicts whether or not a tumor is malignant or benign.
