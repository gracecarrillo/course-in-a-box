# Data Science Projects you can look at and try for yourself!

Do you want to try out some challenging Data Science projects? Or just see what they look like? 

Check these real-world Data Science projects with source code: 

## Signal Processing

[Classify human movements using Dynamic Time Warping & K Nearest Neighbors:](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/markdregan/K-Nearest-Neighbors-with-Dynamic-Time-Warping/blob/master/K_Nearest_Neighbor_Dynamic_Time_Warping.ipynb) Signals from a smart phone gyroscope and accelerometer are used to classify if the person is running, walking, sitting standing etc. This IPython notebook contains a python implementation of DTW and KNN algorithms along with explanations and a practical application.

## Biology

[An introductory notebook on uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/lrhgit/uqsa_tutorials/blob/master/index.ipynb) developed for the [Workshop On Uncertainty Quantification And Sensitivity Analysis For Cardiovascular Modeling](http://sathercenter.berkeley.edu/peder-sather-grant/2016-grantees/) by Leif Rune Hellevik, Vinzenz Eck and Jacob T. Sturdy.

[Lung Cancer Post-Translational Modification and Gene Expression Regulation](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/MaayanLab/CST_Lung_Cancer_Viz/blob/master/notebooks/CST_Data_Viz.ipynb?flush_cache=true). This Python notebook uses the Jupyter-widget [Clustergrammer-Widget](http://clustergrammer.readthedocs.io/clustergrammer_widget.html) to visualize hierarchical clustering of gene expression and post-translational modification data from 37 lung cancer cell lines as an interactive heatmap. The notebook is part of the research project from this [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2017151).

[An open RNA-Seq data analysis pipeline tutorial with an example of reprocessing data from a recent Zika virus study](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/maayanlab/Zika-RNAseq-Pipeline/blob/master/Zika.ipynb). This notebook fully reproduces the research published in [this paper](https://f1000research.com/articles/5-1574/v1). The notebook uses mostly python but includes some bash and R as well and is relevant for researchers in bioinformatics and public health.

[Learning Population Genetics in an RNA world](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/gocarli/RNA-Popgen-Notebook/blob/master/Population_Genetics.ipynb) is an interactive notebook that explains basic population genetics tools and techniques by building an in silico evolutionary model of RNA molecules.

## Physics & Chemistry

[AeroPython: Aerodynamics-Hydrodynamics with Python](https://github.com/barbagroup/AeroPython), a complete course taught at George Washington University by [Lorena Barba](http://lorenabarba.com/).

[A single-atom laser model](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/jrjohansson/qutip-lectures/blob/master/Lecture-2B-Single-Atom-Lasing.ipynb). This is one of a complete set of [lectures on quantum mechanics and quantum optics using QuTiP](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/jrjohansson/qutip-lectures) by [J.R. Johansson](https://github.com/jrjohansson).

[Working with Reactions](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/4316430), part of a set of [tutorials on cheminformatics and machine learning](http://code.google.com/p/rdkit/wiki/UGM2012Tutorials) with the rdkit project, by Greg Landrum.

[CFD Python: 12 steps to Navier-Stokes](http://lorenabarba.com/blog/cfd-python-12-steps-to-navier-stokes). A complete set of lectures on Computational Fluid Dynamics, from 1-d linear waves to full 2-d Navier-Stokes, by [Lorena Barba](http://lorenabarba.com/).

## Pure Stats 

[Take Off with Stats in Python](https://github.com/engineersCode/EngComp2_takeoff) by [Lorena Barba](http://lorenabarba.com/): Hands-on data analysis using a computational approach and real-life applications. With an accompanying [online course](http://go.gwu.edu/engcomp2).
